# Economical-Impact-of-Covid-19
Abstract:

As the United States prepares for a COVID-19 recovery, policymakers need to understand why some states and communities were more vulnerable to the pandemicâ€™s economic consequences than others. In this project, we particularly focus on Michigan State to analyze the Covid-19 impact on its economy. We target the key features of the sates economy that rely on the movement of people - such as Michigan's automobile industry - faced substantially higher unemployment at the end of 2020 than other industries based on the movement of information. 

Underlying motive:

The theme of this project is to find the correlation between Covid-19 death rate and the other data frames; such as, unemployment, auto sale etc.
